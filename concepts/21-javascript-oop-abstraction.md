Abstraction in object-oriented programming is a principle that helps in hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. In JavaScript, we can achieve abstraction using classes by defining methods that interact with the private data, without exposing the details of the data or the methods themselves.

Here's an example to demonstrate abstraction using JavaScript classes:

```javascript
class Vehicle {
  // Private properties (conventionally use _ or #)
  #speed
  #fuel

  constructor(speed, fuel) {
    this.#speed = speed
    this.#fuel = fuel
  }

  // Public method to display vehicle status
  getStatus() {
    return `Speed: ${this.#speed} km/h, Fuel: ${this.#fuel} liters`
  }

  // Public method to drive the vehicle
  drive(distance) {
    const fuelNeeded = distance / 10
    if (fuelNeeded <= this.#fuel) {
      this.#fuel -= fuelNeeded
      this.#speed += 10
      console.log(`Drove ${distance} km. ${this.getStatus()}`)
    } else {
      console.log('Not enough fuel to drive the distance.')
    }
  }

  // Public method to refuel the vehicle
  refuel(amount) {
    this.#fuel += amount
    console.log(`Refueled ${amount} liters. ${this.getStatus()}`)
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Vehicle class
const myCar = new Vehicle(60, 20)

// Interacting with the vehicle using public methods
myCar.drive(50) // Drove 50 km. Speed: 70 km/h, Fuel: 15 liters
myCar.refuel(10) // Refueled 10 liters. Speed: 70 km/h, Fuel: 25 liters
myCar.drive(200) // Not enough fuel to drive the distance.
```

### Explanation:

1. **Private Properties**: The `#speed` and `#fuel` properties are private, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
2. **Constructor**: Initializes the private properties `#speed` and `#fuel`.
3. **Public Methods**:
   - `getStatus()`: Returns the current status of the vehicle.
   - `drive(distance)`: Calculates the required fuel for the given distance and drives the vehicle if there's enough fuel.
   - `refuel(amount)`: Adds fuel to the vehicle.

By using this class abstraction, we ensure that the internal state of the `Vehicle` class (like speed and fuel) is hidden from the outside world, and can only be manipulated through well-defined methods. This enhances the maintainability and security of the code.
